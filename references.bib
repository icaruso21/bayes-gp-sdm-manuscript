   abstract = {Predictive species distribution models are mostly based on statistical dependence between environmental and distributional data and therefore may fail to account for physiological limits and biological interactions that are fundamental when modelling species distributions under future climate conditions. Here, we developed a state-of-the-art method integrating biological theory with survey and experimental data in a way that allows us to explicitly model both physical tolerance limits of species and inherent natural variability in regional conditions and thereby improve the reliability of species distribution predictions under future climate conditions. By using a macroalga-herbivore association (Fucus vesiculosus - Idotea balthica) as a case study, we illustrated how salinity reduction and temperature increase under future climate conditions may significantly reduce the occurrence and biomass of these important coastal species. Moreover, we showed that the reduction of herbivore occurrence is linked to reduction of their host macroalgae. Spatial predictive modelling and experimental biology have been traditionally seen as separate fields but stronger interlinkages between these disciplines can improve species distribution projections under climate change. Experiments enable qualitative prior knowledge to be defined and identify cause-effect relationships, and thereby better foresee alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning under future climate conditions that are not necessarily seen in projections based on non-causal statistical relationships alone.},

   abstract = {Globally accelerating trends in societal development and human environmental impacts since the mid-twentieth century 1-7 are known as the Great Acceleration and have been discussed as a key indicator of the onset of the Anthropocene epoch 6. While reports on ecological responses (for example, changes in species range or local extinctions) to the Great Acceleration are multiplying 8,9 , it is unknown whether such biotic responses are undergoing a similar acceleration over time. This knowledge gap stems from the limited availability of time series data on biodiversity changes across large temporal and geographical extents. Here we use a dataset of repeated plant surveys from 302 mountain summits across Europe, spanning 145 years of observation, to assess the temporal trajectory of mountain biodiversity changes as a globally coherent imprint of the Anthropocene. We find a continent-wide acceleration in the rate of increase in plant species richness, with five times as much species enrichment between 2007 and 2016 as fifty years ago, between 1957 and 1966. This acceleration is strikingly synchronized with accelerated global warming and is not linked to alternative global change drivers. The accelerating increases in species richness on mountain summits across this broad spatial extent demonstrate that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences not only for biodiversity, but also for ecosystem functioning and services. Mountains are particularly sensitive to ecological change and are experiencing some of the highest rates of warming under anthropogenic climate change 10,11. Numerous reports of species redistribution towards summits 8,12-14 and warming-induced changes in biodiversity on summits 13,15,16 suggest that mountain biota are highly sensitive to increasing temperatures 17. The current accelerating trend in temperature increase 1,6 should therefore also affect the velocity of changes observed for mountain biota. Appropriate empirical assessments of the rate of change in the velocity of ecological responses (biodiversity and ecosystem trajectories) to accelerated global warming require long-term resurveys (for example, time series) of species communities, but these are scarce and localized. Mountain summits are especially suited for long-term studies of biotic responses to environmental changes because they represent natural permanent study sites that are easy to relocate over time 18,19 , thus making it possible to record reliable time series. By repeatedly resurveying alpine plant communities on 302 European mountain summits dating back as far as 1871, we generated time series for century-scale and continent wide biodiversity dynamics to assess potential acceleration trends in plant diversity dynamics (Fig. 1). Using these time series data, we tested whether the recent acceleration of climate change is driving a similarly accelerating change in species richness on mountain summits across the continent. We found that plant species richness has increased strongly over the past 145 years on the vast majority (87%) of Europe's summits (generalized linear mixed effects model, P < 0.001; Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig.},

@report{Parmesan2003,
   abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1 (IPCC) assessed the extent to which recent observed changes in natural biological systems have been caused by climate change. This was a difficult task despite documented statistical correlations between changes in climate and biological changes 2-5. With hindsight, the difficulties encountered by the IPCC can be attributed to the differences in approach between biologists and other disciplines, particularly economists. Studies in this area are, of necessity, correlational rather than experimental, and as a result, assignment of causation is inferential. This inference often comes from experimental studies of the effects of temperature and precipitation on the target species or on a related species with similar habitats. Confidence in this inferential process is subjective, and differs among disciplines, thus resulting in the first divergence of opinion within the IPCC. The second impasse came from differences in perspective on what constitutes an 'important' factor. Anyone would consider a currently strong driver to be important, but biologists also attach importance to forces that are currently weak but are likely to persist. In contrast, economic approaches tend to discount events that will occur in the future, assigning little weight to weak but persistent forces. Differences of opinion among disciplines can therefore stem naturally from whether the principal motivation is to assess the magnitude of immediate impacts or of long-term trajectories. Most field biologists are convinced that they are already seeing important biological impacts of climate change 1-4,6-9 ; however, they have encountered difficulty in convincing other academic disciplines, policy-makers and the general public. Here, we seek to improve communication, provide common ground for discussion, and give a comprehensive summary of the evidence. How should a 'climate fingerprint' be defined? A straightforward view typical of an economist would be to conclude that climate change was important if it were principally responsible for a high proportion of current biotic changes. By this criterion a climate fingerprint appears weak. Most short-term local changes are not caused by climate change but by land-use change and by natural fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of species. This fact has been used by non-biologists to argue that climate change is of little importance to wild systems 10. This approach, however, effectively ignores small, systematic trends that may become important in the longer term. Such underlying trends would be confounded (and often swamped) by strong forces such as habitat loss. Biologists have tended to concentrate on studies that minimize confounding factors, searching for trends in relatively undisturbed systems and then testing for significant associations with climate change. Economists have viewed this as biased (nonrandom exclusion of data) whereas biologists view this as reducing non-climatic noise. Thus, economists focus on total direct evidence and apply heavy time discounting; biologists apply a 'quality control' filter to available data, accept indirect (inferential) evidence and don't apply time discounting. The test for a globally coherent climate fingerprint does not require that any single species show a climate change impact with 100% certitude. Rather, it seeks some defined level of confidence in a climate change signal on a global scale. Adopting the IPCC 'levels of confidence' 11 and applying the economists' view of a fingerprint, we would have "very high confidence" in a fingerprint if we estimated that more than 95% of observed changes were principally caused by climate change, "high confidence" between 95% and 67%, "medium confidence" between 33% and 67%, and "low confidence" below 33%. In contrast, the biologists' confidence level comes from the statistical probability that global biotic trends would match climate change predictions purely by chance, coupled with supporting experimental results showing causal relationships between climate and particular biological traits. Here, we present quantitative estimates of the global biological impacts of climate change. We search for a climate fingerprint in the overall patterns, rather than critiquing each study individually. Using the biologists' approach, we synthesize a suite of correlational studies on diverse taxa over many regions to ask whether natural systems, in general, have responded to recent climate change. Furthermore, we attempt a cross-fertilization by applying an economists' measure-the estimated proportion of observed changes for which climate trends are the principal drivers-to data sets chosen using biologists' criteria. We call this a 'global coherence' approach to the detection of climate change impacts. First, we explore a biologists' confidence assessment with two types of analyses of observed change: statistical meta-analyses of effect size in restricted data sets and more comprehensive categorical analyses of the full literature. Second, we present a probabilistic model that considers three variables: proportion of observations matching climate change predictions, numbers of competing explanations for each of those observations, and confidence in causal articles NATURE | VOL 421 | 2 JANUARY 2003 | www.nature.com/nature 37},

   abstract = {Two major approaches address the need to predict species distributions in response to environmental changes. Correlative models estimate parameters phenomenologically by relating current distributions to environmental conditions. By contrast, mechanistic models incorporate explicit relationships between environmental conditions and organismal performance, estimated independently of current distributions. Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions into biologically relevant metrics (e.g. potential duration of activity), models that capture environmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity, and models that use energetics to link environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and three mechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris) and a fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Correlative and mechanistic models performed similarly in predicting current distributions, but mechanistic models predicted larger range shifts in response to climate change. Although mechanistic models theoretically should provide more accurate distribution predictions, there is much potential for improving their flexibility and performance. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is widely used in ecology, and predictions of species distributions inform both policy and ecological debates. Therefore, methods with high predictive accuracy and those that enable biological interpretation are preferable. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a highly flexible approach to statistical modelling and have recently been proposed for SDM. GP models fit smooth, but potentially complex response functions that can account for high-dimensional interactions between predictors. We propose fitting GP SDMs using deterministic numerical approximations, rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to make GPs more computationally efficient and easy to use. We introduce GP models and their application to SDM, illustrate how ecological knowledge can be incorporated into GP SDMs via Bayesian priors and formulate a simple GP SDM that can be fitted efficiently. This model can be fitted either by learning the hyperparameters or by using a fixed approximation to them. Using a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey data set, we compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of these models with several commonly used SDM approaches for both presence/absence and presence-only data. Predictive accuracy of GP SDMs fitted by Laplace approximation was greater than boosted regression trees, generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression when trained on presence/absence data and greater than all of these models plus MaxEnt when trained on presence-only data. GP SDMs fitted using a fixed approximation to hyperparameters were no less accurate than those with MAP estimation and on average 70 times faster, equivalent in speed to GAMs. As well as having strong predictive power for this data set, GP SDMs offer a convenient method for incorporating prior knowledge of the species' ecology. By fitting these methods using efficient numerical approximations, they may easily be applied to large data sets and automatically for many species. An r package, GRaF, is provided to enable SDM users to fit GP models.},

   abstract = {The terms 'habitat', 'environment' and 'niche' are used inconsistently, and with some confusion, within the ecological literature on species distribution and abundance modelling. Here I suggest interrelated working definitions of these terms whereby the concept of habitat remains associated with descriptive/correlative analyses of the environments of organisms, while the niche concept is reserved for mechanistic analyses. To model the niche mechanistically, it is necessary to understand the way an organism's morphology, physiology, and especially behaviour, determine the kinds of environment it experiences when living in a particular habitat, and it is also necessary to understand how those environmental conditions affect fitness (growth, survival and reproduction). While distributions can potentially be predicted by modelling descriptions or correlations between organisms and habitat components, we must model an organism's niche mechanistically if we are to fully explain distribution limits. A mechanistic understanding of the niche is also critical when we want to predict an organism's distribution under novel circumstances such as a species introduction or climate change. © OIKOS.},

The prior over functions is defined implicitly by the mean and covariance function, which determine the smoothness and variability of the function.

Despite their attractive theoretical properties GPs provide practical challenges in their implementation. GPstuff is a versatile collection of computational tools for GP models compatible with Linux and Windows MATLAB and Octave.
